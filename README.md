FROM
    job_postings_fact 
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND 
    job_location = 'London, UK' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 5. Best Skills To Learn 
What are the top skills that aspiring data analysts should be learning?

```sql
SELECT
    skills_dim.skill_id,
    skills_dim.skills,
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id) AS demand_count,
    ROUND(AVG(job_postings_fact.salary_year_avg), 0) AS avg_salary
FROM job_postings_fact
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    skills_dim.skill_id
HAVING 
    COUNT(skills_job_dim.job_id)>10
ORDER BY
   demand_count DESC, 
   avg_salary DESC
    
LIMIT 5;
```

#### **What should aspiring analysts therefore learn to begin with?**
- **Start with SQL**: With the highest demand (3,083 listings), SQL is the most essential tool for querying databases—an everyday task in data analysis. It’s a must-have for landing interviews.

- **Learn Python to boost your value**: While slightly less in demand than SQL, Python offers the highest salary (£101,512) among these skills. It’s key for automating tasks, data wrangling, and advanced analytics, giving you a competitive edge.

- **Excel and Tableau are still crucial**: These tools are widely used in business environments and often required in analyst roles. Their high demand shows they’re expected, but they offer lower salaries, so consider mastering them early, then building toward more technical skills.

- **Consider R if you're data-science oriented**: It has a moderate salary (£98,708) and lower demand, but it’s powerful for statistical analysis—especially useful in academic or research-heavy analyst roles.

| Skill   | Demand Count | Average Salary (£) |
|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| SQL     | 3,083         | 96,435              |
| Excel   | 2,143         | 86,419              |
| Python  | 1,840         | 101,512             |
| Tableau | 1,659         | 97,978              |
| R       | 1,073         | 98,708              |




# What I Learned

**🧠 1. Foundational SQL Skills**

- I started this project with no prior SQL knowledge. Through hands-on practice, I learned how to write SQL queries to extract insights from real-world job listings.

- I now understand how to:

  - Use SELECT, WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and subqueries (e.g., WITH statements).

  - Combine datasets to answer specific business questions (like salary trends or in-demand skills).

- This built my confidence in using SQL to perform real data analysis, not just basic tutorials.

**🗃️ 2. How to Work with Real-World Data**

- I learned how to focus analysis on specific locations (e.g., London) and roles (e.g., Data Analyst) to tailor insights to a personal or business context.

**📈 3. What Makes a Data Job High-Paying**

- I discovered that high salaries are linked to more specialized and technical roles, especially in AI, data engineering, and research (e.g., at companies like DeepMind and Meta).

- This made me realize the value of developing niche technical skills if I want to target top-paying roles.

**🧩 4. Which Skills Are Most Valuable**

- I learned the difference between in-demand and high-paying skills:

  - SQL and Excel are highly in demand — essential for getting in the door.

  - Python, Pandas, and Machine Learning tools (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow) are highly paid — key for advancing and specializing.

- I also saw how skills like Tableau and Power BI are valued for communication and storytelling — something every data analyst should master.

**🎯 5. How to Strategically Plan My Learning**

- Based on the data, I created a clear learning path:

  - Master SQL – the most demanded skill, fundamental to all roles.

  - Develop Python skills – boosts salary potential and opens doors to automation and machine learning.

  - Get confident with Excel and Tableau – expected in many analyst roles and good for building dashboards.

  - Learn advanced tools like Pandas, NumPy, and PyTorch later — especially if I want to transition toward data science or AI roles.

**💡 6. Data Analysis is About Asking the Right Questions**
- This project showed me how data is only as useful as the questions you ask of it.

- Every SQL query was tied to a specific business goal: salary trends, required skills, hiring companies, etc.

- I’ve gained a new perspective on how to use data to answer practical, career-relevant questions.

**🔧 7. Technical Tools & Workflow**

- I got hands-on experience with:

  - PostgreSQL – to store and query structured data.

  - Visual Studio Code – for running and organizing SQL scripts.

  - Git & GitHub – to manage version control and share work, just like in real team projects.
